# Things to do:

## Be source control aware, and flag matches that are .gitignored, or not added to TFS

## Have "favourite" search paths, that can have a friendly name and be easily selected
eg. All TFS, Connectivity, Database...
yeah, it has the recent list, but i want something more betterer.

## Move more stuff from hardcoded into settings file
and add a UI to tweak it
* file & path openers
* binary file types
